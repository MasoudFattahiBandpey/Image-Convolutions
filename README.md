Convolutional operations allow computers to detect features in images using mathematical filters. This lab demonstrates how convolutions help in tasks such as:
- Edge detection using Prewitt and Sobel operators
- Feature enhancement with Difference of Gaussians (DoG)

## Exercises
### 1. Implementing Edge Detection
- Applying Prewitt and Sobel operators to identify edges in images

### 2. Implementing Corner/Blob Detection
- Using Difference of Gaussians (DoG) for feature extraction

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pillow
